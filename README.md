# NBA-2021-22-Season-Analysis
In-depth analysis and Data Visualization of the 2021-22 NBA season to find key insights about the players and teams during the regular season and playoffs, using a Python application.

The datasets used in this assignment are 2021-22 NBA Player Stats for Regular and Playoffs season. 
They provide information about the player and team stats per game for the NBA 2021-22 season.
The datasets have 30 variables: Rk, Player, Pos, Age, Tm, G, GS, MP, FG, FGA, FG%, 3P, 3PA, 3P%, 2P,
2PA, 2P%, eFG%, FT, FTA, FT%, ORB, DRB, TRB, AST, STL, BLK, TOV, PF, PTS.
The datasets have been interrogated and visualised using bar plot, boxplot, heatmap, hexbin plot,
scatter plot, histogram etc. This enables us to analyse the data efficiently and to have a better
understanding of the potential findings and relationships between variables.

Recorded Variables:-
1) Player – Player’s Name
2) Pos – Player’s Position
3) Age – Player’s Age
4) Tm – Player’s Team
5) G – Games Played
6) GS – Games Started
7) MP – Minutes Played per game
8) FG – Field Goals per game
9) FGA – Field Goals attempts per game
10) FG% - Field Goal percentage
11) 3P – Three point field goals made per game
12) 3PA – Three point field goals attempted per game
13) 3P% - Three point field goal percentage
14) 2P – Two point field goals made per game
15) 2PA – Two point field goals attempted per game
16) 2P% - Two point field goals percentage
17) eFG% - Effective field goal percentage
18) FT – Free throws made per game
19) FTA – Free throws attempted per game
20) FT% - Free throw percentage
21) ORB – Offensive rebounds per game
22) DRB – Defensive rebounds per game
23) TRB – Total rebounds per game
24) AST – Assists per game
25) STL – Steals per game
26) BLK – Blocks per game
27) TOV – Turnovers per game
28) PF – Personal fouls per game
29) PTS – Points per game
The main objective of this project is to analyse the data and record the findings using Python and
Jupyter notebook.
